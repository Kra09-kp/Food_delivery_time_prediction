Welcome to my Food Delivery Time Prediction project repository! In this project, I aim to predict the time taken for food delivery using machine learning techniques. Below, I outline the steps involved in this project along with key highlights.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to accurately predict the time taken for food delivery, leveraging various machine learning algorithms and techniques. I have performed data collection, exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation to achieve this objective.

## Data Collection and Setup

- I downloaded the dataset from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravmalik26/food-delivery-dataset?select=train.csv].
- I loaded the dataset into Google Colab for further analysis and modeling.

## Data Exploration and Cleaning

- Explored the dataset to understand its structure and features.
- Performed data cleaning tasks, including:
  - Handling missing values such as replacing 'NaN' with 'None' for clarity.
  - Filling missing values for numeric data with the mean and for categorical data with the median.
  - Standardizing the 'Road_traffic_density' column by replacing 'jam' with 'high' for consistency.

## Feature Engineering

- Created new informative features to enhance model performance:
  - Calculated 'prepare_time' by finding the difference between 'time order' and 'time order picked' columns using datetime module.
  - Derived 'is_weekend' and 'is_last_weekend' indicators from the 'order date' column.
  - Utilized the 'Delivery person ID' to create a new 'city code' column.
  - Calculated the distance using the geodisc library based on the latitude and longitude of the restaurant and delivery locations.

## Data Preprocessing

- Scaled features(age,distance) using MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler to ensure uniformity and improve model performance.
- Employed one-hot encoding for categorical features like 'Weatherconditions', 'Road_traffic_density', etc.
- Utilized label encoding for selected columns such as 'Road_traffic_density', 'Is_Weekend', 'Is Last Week of Month', 'Festival'.
- Removed unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset for modeling.

## Model Building and Evaluation

- Experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - XGBoost Regressor
- Identified XGBoost as the most promising algorithm based on performance.
- Evaluated the XGBoost model using cross-validation to ensure robustness and reliability.
- Calculated the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess model performance.
- Achieved Mean Squared Error: 4.54, R^2 Score: 0.93, Mean Absolute Error: 1.54, and RMSE: 2.13 which means the model is performing well.
- Achived Mean CV Score: 0.82, Std CV Score: 0.002 which means the model is performing well.

- Plotted learning curves to visualize model performance and identify potential areas for improvement.
